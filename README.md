# Auto Top-Up Settings Component

This project contains a React component that replicates the functionality and appearance of an auto top-up settings interface using Material-UI components and theming. The component is written in TypeScript.

## Features

1. **Component Structure:**

   - Uses Material-UI's `Slider`, `Switch`, `Button`, and `Typography` components.
   - Implements a responsive design.

2. **State Management:**

   - Uses React's `useState` to manage the state of the auto top-up toggle and the slider value.

3. **Slider and Credits Logic:**

   - Connects the slider to update a display of the associated credits and price.
   - Ensures the slider snaps to predefined credit values.

4. **Auto Top-Up Functionality:**

   - Displays auto top-up settings when the switch is toggled on, and hides them when off.
   - Prints the selected credit amount to the console when the "Confirm auto-purchase" button is clicked.

5. **Styling:**
   - Styles the component using Material-UI's styling solution to match the provided design closely.
   - Customizes button color to purple.
   - Makes the component container have curved corners.
